## TAU CALC :
- currently scrapes isOpen, last year's acceptance and this year's acceptance
- functionality - almost full. Able to retrieve full result sheet using only a gradeSheet. Sum calculation is autuomated. In order for it to be full we need to apply a uniform resultSheet structure that will apply to all universities. 
right now TAU is missing the facualty name
- [   ] todo: scrape each degree's facualty
- [ x ] Finish implementing sum calculation.  (build the getTAUSums func)
- [ x ] finish translation of IDByClass
-


## HUJI CALC :
- it appears that their acceptance site is pretty annoying. so far i've found a way to get all the degrees that are open and will accept you. 
- the juice is in the div with class 'search-results multi'. it contains the list of degrees.
- that div can contain the list of degrees in a straight forward fashion if the toggler is toggled right. otherwise, the degrees are grouped by their facualty.

## BIU CALC :
- accepts dynamic grade sheet
- returns organsied result sheet
- TODO: add sum calculation.
